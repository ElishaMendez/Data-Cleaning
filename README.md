Usign this Data set from Kaggle I learn my Data cleaning: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdurrahmanmorsi/pharmacy-products-pricing-egypt-egp-and-usd

STeps I took to data cleaneed
1. First thing I did was make a copy of the data so I don't lose any intial data by making my changes on a seperate sheet
2. Then i noticed the first column had almost all of the data in it and just need to seperate them base on the delimiter of "|" and "," using the Text to Columns tool in excel.
3. I realigned my columns so they are flushed to the left and to the top right
4. I noticed then there were alot of spaces before and after some of my cells
5. Selected my whole table and use the duplicates tool to check for duplicates
